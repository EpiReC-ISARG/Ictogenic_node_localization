# Ictogenic node localization

### Objective
Epilepsy surgery fails in >30% of patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). The seizure persistence after surgery can be attributed to the inability 
to precisely localize the tissue with an endogenous potential to generate seizures. In this study, we aimed to identify the critical components of the 
epileptic network that were actively involved in seizure genesis.

### Methods
The directed transfer function was applied to intracranial EEG recordings and the effective connectivity was determined with a high temporal and frequency 
resolution. Pre-ictal network properties were compared with ictal epochs to identify regions actively generating ictal activity and discriminate them from 
the areas of propagation.

### Results
Analysis of 276 seizures from 30 patients revealed the existence of a seizure-related network reconfiguration in the gamma-band (25-170 Hz; p<0.005) 
– ictogenic nodes. Unlike seizure onset zone, resecting the majority of ictogenic nodes correlated with favorable outcomes (p<0.012).

### Conclusion
The prerequisite to successful epilepsy surgery is the accurate identification of brain areas from which seizures arise. We show that in FCD-related 
epilepsy, gamma-band network markers can reliably identify and distinguish ictogenic areas in macroelectrode recordings, improve intracranial EEG 
interpretation and better delineate the epileptogenic zone.

### Significance
Ictogenic nodes localize the critical parts of the epileptogenic tissue and increase the diagnostic yield of intracranial evaluation.
